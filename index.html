            Welcome to my first profesional portfolio. As you can see, this site is very basic and might not work at times if the viewport is changed or due to something else that I'm currently clueless about. Getting back to the topic, I am a person that likes to be organized, productive, and respectful. Although my oral skills might be a bit lower than most people, don't be uninterested in starting a conversation with me or talking about the task at hand. I am always ready to listen and be part of a meaningful engagment. My educational background is not stellar, but that is one of the reasons I am learning software development now. I have always been interested in science, specially astrophysics, and I try to do solve problems in a logical way although sometimes time is an issue and makes me take a chance when solving such problem. I consider myself to be a pretty easy person to get along with and can work well with others.
